Amazon Reviews scrapper through product link  

Just Paste your amazon's product links to the 'links'
text file separating each link with "," (for ex by default I've added some links to the text file)

Then execute amazon.py 

That's it.

Let it do rest of the job.

At the end it'll generate Product CSV files with their reviews and details in them.
